# Maath

A collection of useful math helpers, random generators, bits and bobs. 

### Usage

```bash
yarn add maath
```

The library is mostly meant to be used with [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/), so if you are using it outside of a three project, make sure you check the source and - if you don't need the dep - just copy paste!

### Contributing

Do you want to add something? No rules, but keep these in mind:

- no elitism, whatever goes, no matter how small or simple
- try to add explainers to whatever function you add, if you saw it in a tweet link that!
- add a cool example! Make it a sandbox or whatever, just show how the function can be used creatively
- keep copy-paste simple. Try not to add too many inter-dependencies so the functions are copy-paste friendly
- loose typing. Try to add typing, but don't go crazy with generics and complexity
